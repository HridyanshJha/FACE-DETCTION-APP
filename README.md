# FACE-DETCTION-APP
### **🖥️ Face Detection App**  

A real-time **Face Detection App** built using **OpenCV and Python**. This app uses the **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces from a live camera feed and highlights them with bounding boxes. It is designed for real-time applications and can be extended for facial recognition, emotion detection, or security purposes.  

🔹 **Real-time face detection using OpenCV**  
🔹 **Live webcam feed processing**  
🔹 **Uses pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier**  
🔹 **Easy to set up and run**  

Simply run the script, and the app will detect and highlight faces in real-time! 🚀
